# CLHLS_survival_time

This repository is used to verify Yaxi's code for generating and verifying survival time and status. Mistakes found in Yaxi's code will be noted as comments on GitHub. The verfied (rewrite) code in STATA will be uploaded as .do and .ipynb files.

Each wave is archived as a single branch.
